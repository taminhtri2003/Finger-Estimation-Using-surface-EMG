# Finger Estimation Using surface EMG - XAI approach
 To develop and validate a novel, explainable system for accurately estimating finger joint movements from surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, incorporating advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, and providing insights into the physiological aspects of muscle control and finger kinematics.
